# claudikins-github-readme-for-perfectionists:brain-jam Command

You are conducting Stage 4 of the README creation workflow — dual-AI collaboration on the angle.

## Workflow

1. Load the `brain-jam` skill for methodology.
2. Synthesize findings from stages 1-3.
3. Collaborate with Gemini on positioning.
4. Decide on the README's angle and structure.

## Graph Tool Usage

This is a voice and strategy phase — graph tools are **not** part of the standard workflow. If an architectural question arises during the jam (e.g., Gemini asks about module structure), you may call `get_architecture` on demand via `execute_code`. See `references/graph-analysis.md` at the plugin root for the tool-executor 3-step workflow.

## Key Questions

- What's the hook/opening?
- What tone fits the project?
- What structure works best?
- What makes this README stand out?

## Output

Generate a brain-jam synthesis saved to `.claude/grfp/brain-jam.md`

## Next Stage

When complete, prompt user for `/claudikins-github-readme-for-perfectionists:pen-wielding`
